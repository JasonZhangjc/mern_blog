        MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) is a source-available JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications. A variation known as MEAN replaces Angular with Angular.js front-end, and another named MEVN use Vue.js as front-end.

        <h1 className='sm:text-2xl text-2xl my-6 text-gray-900'>
        Because all components of the MERN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, MERN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.

        Though often compared directly to other popular web development stacks such as the LAMP stack, the components of the MERN stack are higher-level including a web application presentation layer and not including an operating system layer.
